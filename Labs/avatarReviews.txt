1|Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years.
2|The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality.
3|Nobody directs like James Cameron. 
4|I did not like the graphics
5|As a film lover I could not miss it, and to make sure I didn't miss out on everything James Cameron had to offer me, I saw it in the largest iMax cinema in England, in 3d.
6|This film has nothing worthy of the box office receipts is has garnered.
7|Any third grader can predict the outcome after the first ten minutes. 
8|Yeah this movie took several steps forward in terms of cinematography and filming technology, but that is all that can really be said to be what makes this film worth seeing.
9|A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. 
10|It's movies like this that are a reminder that story should always be the number one priority when making a movie. 
11|The story ticks all the right boxes, at least for a Cameron film.
12|I did my best to keep the expectations low, but it didn't quite work out.
13|This movie actually blew my mind!
14|James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better
15|I hated this movie.
